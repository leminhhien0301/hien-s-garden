# what is the fear of missing out 
## the fear of missing out^[[ Can we break free from the fear of missing out](../4. Archive 6-10-2022/( Can we break free from the fear of missing out.md\|[[( Can we break free from the fear of missing out]]]
FoMO, a spawn of technological advancement and proliferating social information, is the feeling that we’re missing out on something more exciting, more important, or more interesting going on somewhere else. It is the unease of feeling that others are having a more rewarding experience and we are not a part of it.

sense of missing out is nothing new. An entire body of literature describes the heart-wrenching conflict between romantic aspirations and social conservatism. Edith Wharton, Charlotte Brontë and Stendhal, to name but a few, described the angst of missing out long before we could look up high-school friends on Facebook.

We all know the studies showing that end-of-life regrets centre on what we didn’t do, rather than on what we did. If so, constantly watching others doing things that we are not is fertile ground for a future of looking back in sorrow.
## the fear of missing out is the symptom of infinitude

### technology exacerbate the fear of missing out
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology social psychologist Sherry Turkle, author of *Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other* (2011), says that technology has become the major construct through which we define intimacy. We confuse our hundreds, or even thousands, of ‘friends’ on social networks with the handful of intimate friends we have in reality. Being connected to everyone, all the time, is a new human experience; we’re just not equipped to cope with it yet.
### brain enabling technology exacerbate the fear of missing out
FoMO occurs mostly in people with unfulfilled psychological needs in realms such as love, respect, autonomy and security. All in all, we are afraid of missing out on love and on feeling that we belong; those of us heavily invested in work also fear missing an opportunity for professional advancement or a profitable deal.
### self-understanding mitigates the fear of missing out
Robin Dunbar, author of *How Many Friends Does a Person Need?* (2010), says that the problem might be mitigated if only we understood ourselves more. Dunbar claims that we lack the emotional and intellectual capacity to distinguish between more than about 150 members of a group – the average size of a Neolithic farming village.
### Human are sometimes bound to miss out. 
Q: what actions can we takes to mitigate the effects of the fear of missiong to our quality of life?
C: we are sometimes bound to miss out.
E: The world is so big and rich. even if you spend your entire life consume anything such as book, music, film, ... you won't ever see most of what exists.

### People who choose to optimized are less satisfied with the choice they made than who made do with "good enough"

In a series of experiments led by the Swarthmore College social psychologist Barry Schwartz, participants filled out a self-assessment questionnaire determining their tendency to optimise decisions (based on their agreement with statements such as ‘I never settle for second best’ or ‘I often find it difficult to shop for gift for a friend’). Another questionnaire measured subjects’ propensity to feel regret; participants were then classified according to their answers on both questionnaires. The researchers found a negative correlation between the tendency to optimise and happiness, self-esteem and satisfaction, and a positive correlation between the same tendency and depression, perfectionism and regret. Another study in the series found that people who optimise also engage in more social comparison, and are adversely affected when they come up short.

#### satisficing is practical in the WWII
In business, sacrificing maximisation in favour of a predefined ‘good enough’ is known to be the best strategy in the long run. As the saying goes, ‘Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered’: greediness that looks to maximise doesn’t pay. Business people also know to ‘leave something on the table’, especially in deals leading to long-term partnerships.

In his outstanding book *Why the Allies Won* (1995), the British historian Richard Overy analyses the outcomes of the Second World War, which were not, he claims, a given. One explanation he offers is the German army’s attempt to optimise use of its military munitions at the expense of tactical combat efficiency. At one point in the war, the Germans had no fewer than 425 different kinds of aircraft, 151 kinds of trucks, and 150 kinds of motorcycles. The price they paid for the technical superiority of German-made munitions was difficulty in mass-production, which was ultimately more important from a strategic point of view. In the decisive battles fought in Russia, one German force had to carry approximately one million spare parts for hundreds of types of armed carriers, trucks and motorcycles. The Russians, in contrast, used only two types of tanks, making for much simpler munitions maintenance during war. It was ‘good enough’ for them.
#### Satisficing is practical in relationship.
It was the British psychologist Donald Winnicott who gave us the concept of the ‘good-enough mother’ – a mother sufficiently attentive and adequately responsive to her baby’s basic needs. As the baby develops, the mother occasionally ‘fails’ to answer his needs, preparing him for a reality in which he will not always get exactly what he wants, whenever he wants it. The child learns to delay gratification, a key to any form of adult success. As we mature, we make do with ‘good enough’ partners almost by definition. Yes, out there is someone probably more suited to our needs – but we might not live long enough to find him or her.

- Things are pretty much always fine. But they could also always be better. But it doesn't have to be so. The improvement is not the problem. It's the why that's motivating the improvement that matters. When one compulsively looks to improve oneself, without any greater cause or reason driving it other than self-aggrandizement, it leads to a life of immense self-preoccupation, a light and beneficent form of narcissism where one’s constant attention and focus is on oneself. And ironically, this will probably make your life worse off.
# the instrumentalisational approach to time[^3]
## To use time is to treat it instrumentally. 
Of course we do this every day: you don’t boil the kettle out of a love of boiling kettles. The result is that you find yourself living mentally in the future, locating the “real” value of your life at some time that you haven’t yet reached and maybe never will.
## Treat time instrumentally take out the joy of leisure time
We start to experience pressure to use our leisure time productively too. Enjoying leisure for its own sake make you feel guilty. because you’re not treating your time off primarily as an investment in the future to be a good worker or any label you like. 

Treat leisure time productively take out the joy of doing so. your friend who always seems to be training for a 10k, yet is apparently incapable of just going for a run: she has convinced herself that running is a meaningful thing to do only insofar as it might lead to some future accomplishment. Taking leisure productively make us confused about what do we supposed to use time
## Confronting finitude ^[[[4. Archive 6-10-2022/{ Four Thousand Weeks\|[4. Archive 6-10-2022/{ Four Thousand Weeks]]] 
### Confronting finitude is liberating 
You get to give up on the futile attempt to do everything, please everyone, achieve a perfect work-life balance. (That was always illusory to begin with.) Then you get to dedicate your time and attention to getting stuck in to what counts.
### confronting finitude diminishes the distraction of more and focus on the most important things
Confronting finitude make us focus on the things that are most important. Because we don't have time for the rumor or dumb shit hardly matters to our life. Or as the late American Zen Buddhist teacher Charlotte Joko Beck liked to put it, speaking about the human condition in general, “what makes it unbearable is your mistaken belief that it can be cured.”
