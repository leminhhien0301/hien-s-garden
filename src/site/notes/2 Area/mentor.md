# point
- Psychology of a mentor
	- Will you be my mentor? or even Can I pick your brain? are tainted questions.
	- Here’s what people hear: will you blindly commit to spending 1:1 time with me even though I have given you no reason to do so, and don’t even have a real question?
	- what a mentor likes in student
		- You engage with their work and contribute positively (e.g., share a thoughtful summary of their book, post an insightful response to their Tweet)
		- You apply their ideas / use their product, and give useful feedback
		- You understand what they’re interested in, and share useful resources
		- You ask a specific question that is not easily Googled and is best answered by them given their expertise in X
		- demonstrate you are resourceful and appreciative. Both are signs you’re not going to waste their time.
		- If they do respond with advice, take action! Then follow up with results. Let them know they made a difference.
- perfecting the ask
	- The less familiar someone is with you, the less committed they are to responding. If you want to hear back, make it a no-brainer.
	- To do this, take note of the Question Spectrum, which spans a range of difficulty for the respondent. Easy questions are about their life; medium questions are their take on a relevant topic; hard questions are what they would do in your specific situation.
	- Here’s the catch: easy questions are also satisfying to answer. Letting the other person talk about themselves is fun for them. The hard questions are usually annoying to answer. They feel like work and place a burden of responsibility on them to say the right thing.
	- Easy and satisfying questions are also more likely to start a dialogue
Perils of advice
		- How much context does someone need to answer your question? If they require multiple paragraphs of your life story, you’re asking the wrong opener.
		- Personal advice is heavy and nearly impossible to give unless someone knows you well
		- Advice is also heavily inspired by personal anecdotes. The more different you are from that person (in age, experience, background), the lower the odds that what worked for them will work like magic for you. This is why you can learn more relevant details from people just a few steps ahead than from a mogul.
		- Before you copy someone’s playbook, ask yourself: will this apply to my life?
		- Ultimately, learning from others should turn you into the best mentor for yourself. Nobody has a bigger stake than you.
	- Mentors you sort of know
		- Observing, absorbing, and asking thoughtful questions also apply to people who are in your orbit.
			- Being curious about their work can get you on their radar. It still helps to start with easy questions, but you do have more leeway to explore the heavy stuff if they have context on your situation.
		- the purpose of mentors
			- The real magic of mentorship is not outsourcing your thinking, see multiple perspectives, uncover blind spots, and ideally gain more empathy along the way.
			- But the real magic comes from filtering their perspectives to make better decisions for yourself. When you think independently, you go from chess piece to[chess player](https://www.productlessons.xyz/article/how-to-play-chess-not-checkers).
		- Change
			- To learn from the best, you no longer need to meet them, you just need to absorb them. Ironically, it also happens to be the best way to eventually meet them and earn their respect.

Three types of mentors

- Direct. Someone who is in front of you who will show you how they did it. What is “it”? Wait.

- Indirect. Books. Movies. You can outsource 90% of mentorship to books and other materials. 200-500 books equals one good mentor. People ask me, “what is a good book to read” and I never know the answer. There’s 200-500 good books to read.

- Everything is a mentor. If you are a zero, and have passion for reinvention, then everything you look at will be a metaphor for what you want to do. The tree you see, with roots you don't, with underground water that feeds it, is a metaphor for computer programming if you connect the dots.
## question to ask 
### [[calendar/11 daily note/2022 10 13 - Thu|2022 10 13 - Thu]]
- how to build and maintain connection in the industry
- Is this where you thought you would end up?
- make the most out of the internship? do more? i find it repetitive
- What’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were at the career stage I am currently?
- what can i expect from this relationship? if i have question, i google them most of the time. Asking people is not a norm to me because I don't want to bother other people and like to research on myself and discuss with people without being judged.
- what can i prepare for workplace environment? what is the goal?
- What’s one thing you do regularly that you think makes you better at your job?
- fear of wasting time and opportunities
- take things too seriously and find the reality not as harsh. Let myself loose.
- career goals? how to set
